Streamlit chatbot using GPT4 but configured in Arabic.

Try it out on this link:
https://intellibot-me.streamlit.app/

To create a streamlit app with a clone of this repo, go to streamlit.io and follow the instructions. 

To deploy the bot with your openai API key, please make sure you click on advanced settings and put your openai key in there in this format:

api_key = "YOUR API HERE"

Help needed! Can you suggest a way to:

- fix the alignemnt so that it's right to left?
